## Project Introduction
### Background
The library currently performs data quality checks and reporting manually. This process is time-consuming, prone to human error, and difficult to scale as data volumes increase. There is also limited automation, which prevents stakeholders, librarians, and users from accessing up-to-date information.

### Project Aim
The aim of this project is to design and implement an automated data processing pipeline using Python, GitHub, and Azure DevOps. The solution will clean, validate, and transform library data, producing a presentation-ready dataset for reporting in Power BI.

### Objectives
Reduce manual effort through automation
Improve data quality, consistency, and reliability
Enable repeatable and auditable data transformations
Provide timely insights for operational and strategic decision-making

### User Stories
1. As a stakeholder, I want to reduce manual work and automate our process.
2. As a library user, I want an up-to-date status of our account/books.
3. As a librarian, I want to know how many books are to be returned for planning purposes.
4. As a librarian, I want to see an upt-to-date status of books for late fees, borrowed time, reserved status, etc.
5. As a data engineer, I want a dashboard to see pipeline metrics and trends.
